What is the message embedded in the Noisy.wav sound file from the Noisy.rar file?

 Hint:

1. Use simpleaudio to play a wav file in python.

2. Use import wave to open a wav file in python and extract the sound waveform

3. Use FFT to determine the frequency of the noisy tone.

4. Remove the noisy tone by replacing its amplitude by zero and do the inverse FFT.

6. Convert to the wav file

7. Listen to the sound and you will hear the message if you have successfully removed the noisy tone.
